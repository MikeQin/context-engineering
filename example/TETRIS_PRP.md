## Development Guidance

### Architecture and Design Process
- Before actual development and implementation, create the architecture and design, and present it for review
- If the planned architecture and design meet the project goals, proceed with approval
- Follow established patterns from CLAUDE.md for code organization and structure

### Quality Assurance Standards
- **Code Quality**: Run ESLint frequently during development to ensure lint-free code
- **Testing Strategy**: Implement unit tests for game logic, scoring, and state management
- **Build Verification**: Ensure the project builds successfully with `npm run build` before completion
- **Performance Testing**: Verify smooth 60fps gameplay on target devices
- **Security Testing**: Basic dependency vulnerability scanning

### Development Best Practices
- Break down large code blocks into small, focused functions
- Refactor code into multiple files when files exceed reasonable size limits
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly express intent
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback throughout the application
- Follow the Next.js and JavaScript conventions outlined in CLAUDE.md

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All core MVP features implemented and tested
- [ ] Application is completely lint-free and passes all quality gates
- [ ] Smooth gameplay performance on desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Responsive design works across all target screen sizes
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle functions correctly

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning and Design
1. **Read the existing `CLAUDE.md`** for Development Methodology (Engineering Standards)
2. **Generate `DESIGN.md`** using one of these methods:

**Option A: Claude CLI Command (Recommended)**
```bash
/generate_design ./example/TETRIS_PRP.md
```

**Option B: Manual AI Prompt**
```
I have created a PRODUCT_PRP.md file with my project requirements and I'm using CLAUDE.md for development methodology. Please read both files and generate a comprehensive DESIGN.md document that includes:

1. Problem statement and context
2. Possible implementation approaches with trade-offs
3. Architecture and system design
4. Testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, security scans)
5. Technology stack justification 
6. Project structure (tree-style directory layout)
7. External dependencies and integrations
8. Documentation references
9. Acceptance criteria and success metrics
10. Technical diagrams (Mermaid diagrams when helpful)

Please ensure the DESIGN.md follows the architecture patterns and quality standards defined in CLAUDE.md, and fully addresses all requirements specified in PRODUCT_PRP.md.

Lastly, save the generated file as 'TETRIS_GAME_DESIGN.md' in the current directory (./example/).
```

3. **Review the generated `DESIGN.md`** for Architecture & Implementation (Technical Design) ensuring it includes:
   - Problem statement and context
   - Possible implementation approaches with trade-offs
   - Architecture and system design for game state management
   - Testing strategy (unit tests for game logic, integration tests)
   - Security considerations and vulnerability assessment
   - Technology stack justification and component architecture
   - Project structure (tree-style directory layout)
   - External dependencies and integrations
   - Documentation references and examples
   - Acceptance criteria and success metrics
   - Technical diagrams (Mermaid diagrams for game flow and component relationships)

### Phase 2: Implementation
4. **Use this PRP, generated `DESIGN.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`** to guide implementation
5. **Follow iterative development** with regular quality checks and testing
6. **Maintain documentation** throughout the development process

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance and Deployment
7. **Complete all quality gates** defined in the success criteria
8. **Perform final testing** on all target devices and browsers
9. **Prepare for deployment** with production-ready configuration
