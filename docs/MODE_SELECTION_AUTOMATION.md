  Team_Settings: "Organization preferences"
  
Decision_Matrix:
  Beginner + Complex_Project → Standard_Mode
  Experienced + Routine_Task → Token_Saving_Mode

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Adaptive Learning System

**Approach**: Machine learning model that adapts to user behavior patterns.

```yaml
Learning_Inputs:
  User_Behavior:
    - Command frequency and patterns
    - Mode selection preferences
    - Task completion rates
    - Error patterns and recovery
    
  Context_Factors:
    - Project complexity metrics
    - Time constraints
    - Team size and composition
    - Quality requirements
    
  Outcome_Metrics:
    - Task success rates
    - Time to completion
    - Token efficiency achieved
    - User satisfaction scores
```

**Implementation**:
```python
class ModeSelector:
    def recommend_mode(self, context):
        # Analyze user experience level
        user_level = self.assess_user_experience(context.user_history)
        
        # Evaluate project context
        project_complexity = self.analyze_project_context(context.project)
        
        # Check token constraints
        token_budget = self.evaluate_token_budget(context.session)
        
        # Apply decision matrix
        return self.decision_matrix(user_level, project_complexity, token_budget)
```

### Strategy 2: Rule-Based Expert System

**Approach**: Deterministic rules based on measurable criteria.

```yaml
Decision_Rules:
  Rule_1: "First_Time_User → Standard_Mode"
  Rule_2: "Complex_Architecture_Analysis → Standard_Mode"
  Rule_3: "Routine_Development + Experienced_User → Token_Saving_Mode"
  Rule_4: "High_Frequency_Operations + Expert_User → Minimal_Mode"
  Rule_5: "Token_Budget_Critical → Minimal_Mode (override)"
  Rule_6: "Stakeholder_Presentation → Standard_Mode (override)"
```

**Decision Tree**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{First Time User?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Standard Mode]
    B -->|No| D{Token Budget Critical?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Minimal Mode]
    D -->|No| F{High Frequency Operation?}
    F -->|Yes| G{Expert User?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Minimal Mode]
    G -->|No| I[Token-Saving Mode]
    F -->|No| J{Complex Analysis?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Standard Mode]
    J -->|No| L[Token-Saving Mode]
```

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Recommendation System

**Approach**: Combines rule-based decisions with learning optimization.

```yaml
Hybrid_Components:
  Base_Rules: "Core decision logic for safety and quality"
  Learning_Layer: "Optimization based on user patterns"
  Override_System: "Manual preferences and special cases"
  Feedback_Loop: "Continuous improvement from outcomes"
