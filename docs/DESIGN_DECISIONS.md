## Decision #001: Non-Deterministic Generation Behavior

**Date**: 2025-07-07  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Analysis of `/generate_design` command behavior and business implications

### The Critical Architectural Concern

The `/generate_design` command is **NOT idempotent**, and this has important business implications.

### Problem Statement

Running `/generate_design` twice with the same PRP.md will likely produce different DESIGN.md files.

### Root Causes

#### 1. AI Generation Variance
Claude's responses vary between runs due to:
- Temperature settings in the model
- Different reasoning paths
- Contextual variations
- Token sampling randomness

#### 2. No Deterministic Control
The framework doesn't enforce:
- Consistent architectural decisions
- Identical section organization
- Same technical choices
- Reproducible outputs

### Business Impact Analysis

#### ‚úÖ Potential Business Benefits

1. **Creative Exploration**: Different runs might reveal alternative architectural approaches
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Teams can generate multiple options and choose the best
3. **Avoiding Tunnel Vision**: Prevents lock-in to a single design approach
4. **Adaptability**: Framework evolves with new best practices over time

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Business Risks & Concerns

1. **Inconsistent Team Standards**: Different developers get different architectures
2. **Review Complexity**: Hard to establish consistent review criteria
3. **Decision Paralysis**: Too many valid options can slow decision-making
4. **Quality Variance**: Some generations might be better than others
5. **Version Control Confusion**: Multiple DESIGN.md versions in Git history

### Considered Solutions

#### Option 1: Embrace Non-Determinism (Current Approach)

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Generate multiple options, pick the best
/generate_design ./project/PRP.md  # Version A
mv PROJECT_DESIGN.md PROJECT_DESIGN_v1.md
/generate_design ./project/PRP.md  # Version B  
mv PROJECT_DESIGN.md PROJECT_DESIGN_v2.md
# Team reviews both, picks best approach
```

**Pros**: Leverages AI creativity, provides options  
**Cons**: Requires additional decision overhead

#### Option 2: Add Deterministic Controls

**Potential Enhancements:**
- Architectural preference flags
- Consistent decision trees
- Seeded generation for reproducibility
- Template-based constraints

**Pros**: Predictable outputs  
**Cons**: May limit creative exploration, requires framework complexity

#### Option 3: Human-in-the-Loop Validation

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Current workflow
/generate_design ./project/PRP.md
# Review and approve before proceeding
/execute_project ./project  # Only after DESIGN.md approval
```

**Pros**: Quality control, team alignment  
**Cons**: Slower process, requires skilled reviewers

### Decision

**Status**: **ACCEPTED** - Embrace Non-Determinism with Enhanced Documentation

### Rationale

1. **Core Value Alignment**: Non-determinism aligns with framework goal of leveraging AI creativity
2. **Manageable Risks**: Business risks can be mitigated through process and documentation
3. **Implementation Simplicity**: No complex technical changes required
4. **User Education**: Clear documentation helps teams make informed decisions

### Implementation

1. ‚úÖ **Documentation Added**: Comprehensive explanation in README.md
2. ‚úÖ **Best Practices Defined**: Clear guidance for different use cases
3. ‚úÖ **Workflow Examples**: Concrete implementations for teams
4. üîÑ **Future Enhancement**: Consider `--deterministic` flag for v2.0

### Future Framework Enhancement Recommendation

Add optional deterministic control:

```bash
# Reproducible generation (future feature)
/generate_design --deterministic ./project/PRP.md

# Creative generation (current behavior)
/generate_design ./project/PRP.md
```

### Usage Guidelines

#### ‚úÖ Use Non-Deterministic Generation When:
- Exploring new project types
- Want creative architectural options
- Early-stage planning
- Learning/education purposes

#### ‚ùå Consider Alternatives When:
- Enterprise standardization required
- Strict compliance needs
- Team consistency critical
- Production systems with zero-variation requirements

### Monitoring & Review

**Success Metrics:**
- User feedback on documentation clarity
- Framework adoption rates
- Community discussion quality
- Enterprise customer satisfaction

**Review Schedule:** Quarterly assessment of user feedback and business impact
